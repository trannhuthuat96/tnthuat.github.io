Hello! I am a PhD candidate at School of Computing and Information Systems (SCIS), Singapore Management University (SMU). My PhD is funded by Vingroup Young Talent Scholarship. 
At SMU, I have been supervised by <a href="https://www.hadylauw.com/">Prof. Hady W. Lauw</a>. The central theme of my research is interpretability in recommender systems.
Prior to SMU, I was a member of Data Science and Knowledge Technology Laboratory at VNU University of Engineering and Technology (VNU-UET) from Aug 2018 to Jul 2020,
working with <a href="https://uet.vnu.edu.vn/~hieupx/">Prof. Xuan-Hieu Phan</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I1FbHw4AAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Thai-Le Luong</a> on intention mining from social media texts. 
Going back further in time, I obtained my BSc degree (first class honor) in Computer Science from VNU-UET in Jun 2018 under the supervision of <a href="https://uet.vnu.edu.vn/~hieupx/">Prof. Xuan-Hieu Phan</a>.
