Hello! I am a PhD candidate at School of Computing and Information Systems (SCIS), Singapore Management University (SMU). My PhD is funded by Vingroup Young Talent Scholarship. 
At SMU, I have been supervised by [Prof. Hady W. Lauw](https://www.hadylauw.com/). The central theme<br> of my research is interpretability in recommender systems.
Prior to SMU, I was a member<br> of Data Science and Knowledge Technology Laboratory at VNU University of Engineering<br> and Technology (VNU-UET) from Aug 2018 to Jul 2020,
working with [Prof. Xuan-Hieu Phan](https://sites.google.com/site/pxhieu/)<br> and [Dr. Thai-Le Luong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I1FbHw4AAAAJ&hl=en) on intention mining from social media texts. 
Going back further in <br> time, I obtained my BSc degree (first class honor) in Computer Science from VNU-UET<br> in Jun 2018 under the supervision of [Prof. Xuan-Hieu Phan](https://sites.google.com/site/pxhieu/).
